This project simulates a 3D implementation of OpenGL nature. The implementation is done using OpenGL. It
uses GL, GLU and GLUT functions. It contains a building, along with parking area and a basketball court
located nearby. The building and court is situated on the left side of the road.

Some guys are playing basketball in the court and people are moving along the roadside.
People living in the building are standing in the balcony. The movement of the vehicles on the road can be
controlled by using the keyboard or mouse buttons. We can move the vehicles forward as well as reverse it
back using keyboard key. We can seek for help by pressing H key on keyboard and we can close the display
window using ESC key of keyboard.
